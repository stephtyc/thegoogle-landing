As of May 2020, I have been learning to code via The Odin Project.
I am taking the Full Stack Javascript Track.

2020-05-26: 
Log 1 - Just beginning the WebDev101 Project: HTML/CSS section with
easy version Google homepage.

Log 2 - Many hours later, I finished the HTML and CSS style code. I nearly 
wanted to keep using padding to pad my way to stick the footer at the bottom,
however I knew I needed to learn a way to "sticky" the footer so to speak.

Will push to my GitHub repository.
